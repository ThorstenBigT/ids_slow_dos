    "effected_protocol": "MQTT",
    "effected_protocol_version": "3.1.1",
    "description": "The MQTT protocol 3.1.1 requires a server to set a timeout value of 1.5 times the Keep-Alive value specified by a client, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of the ability to establish new connections), as demonstrated by SlowITe."
